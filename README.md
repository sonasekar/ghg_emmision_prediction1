## 💡 Project Title  
### Supply Chain GHG Emission Predictor using AI

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement  
Industries and governments lack tools to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across supply chains. This hinders sustainability monitoring and carbon compliance.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution  
An AI-based regression model trained on multi-year emission data that predicts **GHG margin emission factors (kg CO₂e/unit)** based on:

- Commodity and substance codes  
- Reliability and unit  
- Quality metrics: temporal, geographical, technological, and data collection correlations

---

## 🔍 Phase-wise Execution  

### Phase 1:
- Collect & clean data from 2010–2016 commodity emission records  
- Encode and scale features for model compatibility  
- Train ML model (Random Forest Regressor)  
- Export prediction system as `.pkl` for deployment

### Phase 2:
- Create a responsive React-based web frontend  
- Build Flask backend with REST API for predictions  
- Integrate trained model into full-stack UI for live testing
